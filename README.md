Logical Framework Theory (LFT) - Early Drafts

Author: JD Longmire
Status: Work in Progress

What’s Here

This repo contains early drafts of my work on Logical Framework Theory (LFT)—a framework that explores uncertainty, logic, and reality. The key idea? Uncertainty is epistemological, not ontological.

These are working drafts, and I’m open to feedback.
